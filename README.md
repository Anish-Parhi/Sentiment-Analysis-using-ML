Sentiment Analysis Using Machine Learning
This project implements sentiment analysis using machine learning techniques to classify text as positive, negative, or neutral. It explores various NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques and ML models to analyze sentiments from text data.

Features:
Preprocessing of text data (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization)
Implementation of different ML models (VADER, Roberta Pre-trained Model)
Visualization of sentiment distribution
Printing of results and interpreting the sentiment

Dataset:
The project uses publicly available datasets such as Amazon Fine Food Reviews, Twitter Sentiment Data, or any custom dataset.

Languages and Libraries Used:
Python
Scikit-Learn
NLTK
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib / Seaborn
